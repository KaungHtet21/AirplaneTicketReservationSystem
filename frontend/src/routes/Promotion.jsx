              Membership Program: Frequent Flyer A flight membership program is
              a loyalty program offered by KAE airlines to reward frequent
              flyers. Members of these programs are offered special benefits,
              such as access to airport lounges, priority check-in, free baggage
              allowances, and the ability to earn and redeem points or miles for
              free flights or upgrades.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the benefits that some flight membership programs offer is
              the ability to purchase a certain number of tickets in advance at
              a discounted price. For example, an airline may offer a membership
              program that allows members to purchase 10 tickets at a discounted
              rate, which can be used for future travel. As a member, you'll
              have access to exclusive benefits and rewards to enhance your
              travel experience. One of the key benefits of our program is the
              ability to purchase a specific number of tickets in advance at a
              discounted rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Members can earn flight credits by booking flights through the
              online flight system. Every flight booked earns one flight credit,
              and once a member reaches the required number of flight credits,
              they are automatically upgraded to the next membership level.
              Membership is free; to keep the membership active, newly
              registered members need to fly at least once within the first six
              (6) months â€“ if this no activity is recorded, then membership
              shall be automatically terminated.
