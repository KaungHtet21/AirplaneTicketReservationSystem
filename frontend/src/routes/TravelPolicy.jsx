          ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
        </h2>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
          Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in
          a country other than the country of origin are advised that the
          provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be
          applicable to the entire journey, including any portion entirely
          within the country of origin or destination. For such passenger on a
          journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United
          States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage
          embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of parties
          to such special contract, for death of or personal injury to passenger
          is limited in most cases to prove damages not to exceed US $ 75000 per
          passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend
          on negligence on the part of the carrier. For such passengers
          traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a
          journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United
          States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal
          injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately US $
          10,000 or US $ 20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special
          contracts are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may
          be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained
          by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not
          affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under the Warsaw
          Convention or such special contracts of carriage. For further
          information, please consult your airline or insurance company
          representative. NOTE: The limit of liability of US $ 75,000 above is
          inclusive of legal fees and costs expect that in case of a claim
          brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal
          fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of US $ 58,000 exclusive of
          legal fees and costs.

          NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
        </h2>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
          Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a
          higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid.
          For most international travel (including domestic portions of
          international journeys) the liability4 limit is approximately US $
          9.07 per pound (US $ 20.00 per kilo) for checked baggage and US $
          400.00 per passenger for unchecked baggage. For travel wholly between
          U.S. points, Federal rules require any limit on an airline’s baggage
          liability to be at least US $ 1,250.00 per passenger. Excess valuation
          may be declared on certain types of articles. Some carriers assume no
          liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles. Further
          information may be obtained from the carrier.
